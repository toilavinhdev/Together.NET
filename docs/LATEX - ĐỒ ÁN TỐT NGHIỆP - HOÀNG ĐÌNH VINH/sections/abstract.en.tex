    \textbf{Introduction}\\
    \indent
    In recent years, online forums have become essential platforms for communities
    to share information and knowledge. However, traditional monolithic forum architectures
    often face limitations such as scalability issues, maintenance challenges, and
    high system failure risks. These limitations can negatively impact user
    experience and adaptability to market changes.

    \textbf{Solution Overview}\\
    \indent
    To address these challenges, this thesis proposes a microservices architecture
    for the online forum website. Microservices architecture breaks down the
    application into smaller, independent services that can be developed,
    deployed, and scaled individually. This approach offers several advantages: High
    Scalability, flexibility, maintainability, modern technology adoption

    \textbf{Main contributions and results}\\
    \indent
    The main contribution of the project is the construction of an online forum website
    based on Microservices architecture has brought many benefits compared to legacy
    solutions system. The forum system developed in this topic is not only
    responsive meet feature requirements but also be scalable, flexible and easy
    to maintain.
